#### Absolute time period filters explained

Absolute searches are useful for selecting a range of time between two dates. This can be useful for investigating a known incident.

## Demo Search on Edge Access edge-access.log

We will now do a demo search on the edge access log.

The Edge Access log is the first log in the Section proxy stack and is often a useful log to investigate the interface between Section and the origin server.

### Select _type edge-access.log

Select the edge-access.log by selecting the popular _type filter and then click on the magnifying glass icon. This adds a search filter for the edge proxy.
