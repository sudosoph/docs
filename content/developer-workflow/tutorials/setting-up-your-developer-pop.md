Section Developer PoP runs on Kubernetes. Minikube is a miniature, prepackaged Kubernetes cluster that works locally on a desktop Microsoft Windows, Mac or Linux computer.

Minikube runs in the free and open source [VirtualBox]. 

1. Verify that you have installed VirtualBox
1. Download and install <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases/tag/v0.35.0" target="Minikube" title="Minikube v0.35.0 download">Minikube v0.35.0</a>. Version 0.35.0 is the Section supported version of Minikube. https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases/tag/v0.35.0
1. Download and install <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl" target="kubectl" title="kubctl v1.14.3 download">kubectl v1.14.3</a>. Version v1.14.3 is the Section supported version of kubectl. https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl
1. Start minikube: `minikube start`
1. Initialize the Developer PoP

**Start Minikukbe** 

`minikube start`

Minikube will start as below.

```
minikube start

**Initialize the Developer PoP** 

```
minikube ssh "docker run --rm --net=host -v /var/lib/minikube:/var/lib/minikube:ro sectionio/section-init"
```

Depending on the speed of your internet connection and the power of your computer, the initiation of the Developer PoP can take several minutes.

**Developer PoP Ready**

Now your Developer PoP base is ready, but it has not yet launched any of the specific proxies in your configuration.

Let's change that by **[loading your Section setup into the Developer PoP]({{< relref "developer-workflow/tutorials/loading-your-setup-into-the-developer-pop.md" >}})**.


**Time to Setup**

After each one of these terminal commands, you will need to wait a few moments for Minikube to fully launch all the Section containers. 

If you, for example, try and do the git pushes in the next section immediately after completing the `minikube ssh` command above, you may find that the git daemon or some other relevant component has not yet come online. 

In this case, just wait for a few minutes — the exact time depends upon the speed of your internet connection and specifications of your machine.

Disable repeating messages about the **kubectl** component you won't need: `minikube config set WantKubectlDownloadMsg false`
