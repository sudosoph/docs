The Section platform runs a high availability Global Network so that your Application Edge is ready when and where your customers need it.

Section forms its Global Network by combining the network, compute and security features of the most popular cloud services such as:

* Amazon AWS
* Google Compute Engine
* Microsoft Azure
* DigitalOcean
* Packet
* Rackcorp

Our reach continues to grow as Section incorporates more cloud providers into its Global Network.

If there are other providers that you'd like to use with Section, reach out and let us know — we are always looking to expand our service offerings.

## Run in your own cloud accounts

If you have your own cloud services, you can run Section as a private setup within your own facilities. This can give you peace of mind, cost advantages, or help you reach compliance requirements unique to your situation.

## Replace your Application Delivery Controller

The Section platform can also be run on your origin infrastructure, such as a classic application delivery controller. You can deploy a single instance or a high availability cluster right in your own datacenter or cloud account.

Section brings a wide variety of software that run be run in a point of presence. [Learn about the types of reverse proxy you can run inside Section]({{< relref "getting-started/overview/proxy-options.md" >}}).
