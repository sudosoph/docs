### Overview

Section's platform runs on a multitude of hosting providers which means we do not provide a static set of IP addresses. This can be a problem if you wish to whitelist Section traffic to your origin infrastructure.

The best way to achieve this is with [HTTP Basic Authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication).

You can also use a secret key header like so (E.g. in VCL):
