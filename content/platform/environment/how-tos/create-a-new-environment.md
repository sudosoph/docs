This is a guide for setting up a new environment within an existing Section application.

### 1) Log Into Aperture

### 2) Click on the Application in which you want the new environment
  The number of options that appear here will vary depending on the number of applications associated with your account.

### 4) Fill in **New Environment Name**
  This **environment name** becomes the name of a git branch within your application repository for the new environment's config. For a thorough explanation of how Section applications and environments use git, see our [overview](/docs/topic-guides/account-management).

### 5) Fill in **Hostname**
  Although Section supports many domains on a single environment, creating a new environment only requires one. If you want to associate your new environment with multiple domains, you can do so once the environment is up and running.
