### 4) Fill in **New Environment Name**
  This **environment name** becomes the name of a git branch within your application repository for the new environment's config .

### 5) Fill in **Hostname**
  Although section.io supports many domains on a single environment, creating a new environment only requires one. If you want to associate your new environment with multiple domains, you can do so once the environment is up and running.
