## 1) Navigate to HTTPS 

Log into your Aperture dashboard and under **Set up** navigate to the **HTTPS** page.


## 2) Select your desired domain

The dropdown will automatically fill with the first domain listed in your application. If that's not the one you want, select the correct one from the dropdown. 

If you have multiple sub domains in this application and wish to upload a wild card certificate or a certificate with multiple domains in the Subject Alternate Name(SAN), you will need to upload the certificate for each domain.

You will see a button entitled "Specify a custom certificate", or "Change custom certificate" depending on whether you have previously uploaded a custom certificate for the application. This will render two input boxes on the page — one for "Public certificate & chain" and the other for "Private key."


## 3) Paste certificate and key

You will need to paste the site certificate and any intermediate certificates into the "Public certificate & chain" box. For a more in-depth guide on determining certificate order than what follows below, click [here](/docs/how-to/https/determine-tls-certificate-order/).

The order of certificates needs to be domain certificate first (might contain the website URL in the filename), followed by any intermediate certificate(s) in order. Make sure NOT to include the root certificate. The certificates should be PEM encoded and will look like this in a text editor:

    
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    /* contents of domain certificate */
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    /* contents of intermediate certificate */
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----

If there are more than one intermediate certificate, you will need to make sure they are copied in correct order.

    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    /* contents of domain certificate */
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    /* contents of intermediate certificate 1*/
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    /* contents of intermediate certificate 2*/
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----

Now copy and paste your private key in to the "Private key" input area. the private key should look like:

    -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    /* contents of private key */
    -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----



## 4) Upload 

Once you have copy and pasted the certificates and private key, click the "Save Changes" button. The portal will perform a check to make sure the certificate is for the correct domain, and the private key is a match for the certificate. Once that is accepted, a deployment is made to the section.io platform and you should see the new certificate on the site in moments. You will also see the uploaded certificate information at the right hand side of the HTTPS page.

You can also check your newly uploaded certificate using either a command line or 3rd party online tool. See [this page for more details](/docs/how-to/https/check-your-current-https-setup/)
