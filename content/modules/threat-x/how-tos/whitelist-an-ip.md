## Overview

By whitelisting an IP address or a CIDR range you can instruct Threat-X to not inspect requests from those IPs. The ThreatX portal allows you to easily whitelist an IP Address or a CIDR range.

## Whitelist an IP Address/CIDR range

As first step you will have to log into the ThreatX portal at x.threatx.io and access `Settings > IWAF` from the navbar.

Select the **Whitelist** tab and click on  **Add Entry** in the top right corner.

![ThreatX - Whitelist](/docs/images/threatx/threatx_whitelist.png)

This will present you with a pop to add the IP address or the CIDR range. Add and click **Submit**.
