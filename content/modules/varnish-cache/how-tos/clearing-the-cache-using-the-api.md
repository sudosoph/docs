1. Here, you'll see an interface to help build your API call. Enter your **account id**, **application id**, **environment name**, and **proxy name**.<br/>These can be obtained from the URL in the management console (go to your aperture homepage and look at the URL - the numbers go accountId -> applicationId -> environmentId). Your **proxy name** is probably `varnish`, but you can also clear cache for other caching proxies.

1. Click **Run**.
1. Now, you'll see a generated request/response cycle for your cache-clear. Pay attention to the response, and notice that the varnish ban expression is appended to the end of the URL as a query string. From here, you can start making automated cache clearing API calls from within your system! Note that these API requests are authenticated using HTTP basic auth and your aperture credentials. To replicate the API calls made from Swagger outside of the portal, simply add --user user@example.com:your_password.
