Out of the box, Section brings up Varnish Cache  metrics. The following is a description of these metrics.

## Varnish Cache Glossary

Key Varnish Cache concepts are described in the [Varnish Cache Glossary.]

## Varnish Cache Counters

Further detail with respect to key Varnish Cache Counters (Source; [Mankier])

### Counter Levels

Info- Informational counters  
Counters giving runtime information

Diag- Diagnostic counters  
Counters giving diagnostic information

Debug- Debug counters  
Counters giving Varnish Cache internals debug information

### Main Counters

sess\_conn  
Sessions accepted (INFO). Count of sessions successfully accepted

sess\_drop  
Sessions dropped (INFO).Count of sessions silently dropped due to lack of worker thread.

sess\_fail  
Session accept failures (INFO). Count of failures to accept TCP connection. Either the client changed its mind, or the kernel ran out of some resource like file descriptors.

sess\_pipe\_overflow  
Session pipe overflow (INFO). Count of sessions dropped due to the session pipe overflowing.

client\_req\_400  
Client requests received, subject to 400 errors (INFO). 400 means we couldn’’t make sense of the request, it was malformed in some drastic way.

client\_req\_411  
Client requests received, subject to 411 errors (INFO). 411 means the client did not send a Content-Length for the req.body.

client\_req\_413  
Client requests received, subject to 413 errors (INFO). 413 means that HTTP headers exceeded length or count limits.

client\_req\_417  
Client requests received, subject to 417 errors (INFO) 417 means that something went wrong with an Expect: header.

client\_req  
Good client requests received (INFO) The count of parseable client requests seen.

cache\_hit  
Cache hits (INFO) Count of cache hits. A cache hit indicates that an object has been delivered to a client without fetching it from a backend server.

cache\_hitpass  
Cache hits for pass (INFO) Count of hits for pass A cache hit for pass indicates that Varnish Cache is going to pass the request to the backend and this decision has been cached in it self. This counts how many times the cached decision is being used.

cache\_miss  
Cache misses (INFO) Count of misses A cache miss indicates the object was fetched from the backend before delivering it to the backend.

backend\_conn

backend\_toolate  
Backend conn. was closed (INFO)

backend\_recycle

fetch\_head
